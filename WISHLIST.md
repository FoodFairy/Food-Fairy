## WISHLIST ##

[ ] react-router - react-router turns the app into a single page app (similar to angular). The router itself is quite simple but some of the dependencies can make it harder to implement. It also appears to require that all of the react components be rendered from the server side. It may also require webpack.
[ ] webpack
[ ] finish Auth
  [ ] persist user searches
  [ ] saved recipes are user specific
  [ ] changing "login" to "logout" when the user is logged in
[ ] hide API key from client
[ ] implement API server side rather than client side
[ ] more powerful search
  [ ] search by calories
  [ ] search by nutrients
      - API has a lot of capabilities, we wish we could have implemented more of them
[ ] be able to organize saved recipes
[ ] live searching


#### BUGS ####
[ ] searching multiple times without leaving the savedpage can cause summaries to fail to update
[ ] searchbar on home page is not currently connected - needs to be connected to the server and pass the search information into the searchpage (and redirect)
